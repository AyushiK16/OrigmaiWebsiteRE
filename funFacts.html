            <li>Origami is the art of folding paper, generally without cutting or gluing, that 
                <br>
                is believed to have originally started in the first or second century AD, in China.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Origami generally involves folding a square piece of paper into a two or three dimensional 
                <br>
                object, while the most common or well known folded object is a paper crane (bird) or ‘orizuru’.</li>
                <br>
            <li>In the sixth century AD, origami was introduced to Japanese people, and it eventually 
                <br>
                became ingrained into the Japanese culture, so much so, that it has been, and is still 
                <br>
                strongly associated with Japan.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Origami paper sizes typically range from 2.5 to 25 centimetre (1 to 10 inch) squares,
                <br>
                 although they can be larger, and the most common size is 15 cm (5.9 inches).</li>
                 <br>
            <li>Although folding paper in origami is typically performed by hand only on a smooth 
                <br>
                surface, tools including a scorer, embosser, paper clips and tweezers 
                <br>
                can be used for better folds or holds.</li>
